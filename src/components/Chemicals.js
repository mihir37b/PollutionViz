PM10 describes inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller.  Under the Clean Air Act, EPA sets and reviews national air quality standards for PM. Air quality monitors measure concentrations of PM throughout the country. EPA, state, tribal and local agencies use that data to ensure that PM in the air is at levels that protect public health and the environment. Nationally, average PM10 concentrations have decreased over the years. For information on PM standards, sources, health effects, and prog"
