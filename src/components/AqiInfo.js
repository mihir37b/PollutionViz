        Think of the AQI as a yardstick that runs from 0 to 500. The higher the
        AQI value, the greater the level of air pollution and the greater the
        health concern. For example, an AQI value of 50 or below represents good
        air quality, while an AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air
        quality. For each pollutant an AQI value of 100 generally corresponds to
        an ambient air concentration that equals the level of the short-term
        national ambient air quality standard for protection of public health.
        AQI values at or below 100 are generally thought of as satisfactory.
        When AQI values are above 100, air quality is unhealthy: at first for
        certain sensitive groups of people, then for everyone as AQI values get
        higher. The AQI is divided into six categories. Each category
        corresponds to a different level of health concern. Each category also
        has a specific color. The color makes it easy for people to quickly
        determine whether air quality is reaching unhealthy levels in their
        communities.
